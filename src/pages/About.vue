    <h1>How We Became So Awesome</h1>
    <p>Imagine this. A dimly lit apartment, seemingly unfurnished, possibly an opium den. A group of men huddle around glowing devices and pour 2 liter plastic bottles of beer for one another. Despite the decrepit surroundings it is clear that a virtuous brotherhood has been formed, one that transcends earthly concerns of materialism and a general need for “keeping up appearances.” There is a palpable tension in the air not dissimilar to the mood surrounding soldiers before a battle. Something momentous is about to take place.</p>
    <p>Rewind a few months and you find yourself in yet another squalid dwelling. It is the early hours of the morning and yet the sounds emanating from this place are unnatural for this time and place. Tribal chants, shrieks of terror (or was it joy?) and a subtle backdrop of sloshing liquid. Our heroes have just survived an all night affair of NFL football streamed live across the globe. The details of what transpire next are appropriately hazy but will alter the future for these young men, these hooligans, these Bad Boys.</p>
    <p>The tension begins to ease. The men realize they are more friend than foe. A draft is transpiring and as each round of acquisitions goes by the subsequent social lubrication of soju follows. These men do not know it yet but they are embarking on a lifelong journey for immorality. Their names forever engraved in the history books. The epic battles recorded in song and passed down from one generation to the next.</p>
    <p>Over the years, dreams will be shattered and legends will be made. PHAKE Hypnotiq will draft half a team of RBs. A foreigner will seize the crown against insurmountable odds. A questionable playoff run in 2016 will catapult an eccentric strategist into the limelight. “Rules were meant to be broken,” an adage not just for successful owners but a founding premise of the brotherhood itself. These Bad Boys will reconvene each year to this hallowed battleground. Eschewing a simply “good” season and instead striving for a Bad one.</p>
    <p>​The Bad Boys Club (BBC) is a fraternal organization founded in Gwangju, SK in 2011. It has chapters throughout the United States and a European outpost in London, England. A subsidiary of the BBC, The BBC Fantasy Football League, had its inaugural season in 2012 and continues to this day.</p>
