  <h2>League Format:</h2>
  <p>The Regular Season is weeks 1-14.</p>
  <p>The Playoffs consists of a head-to-head tournament involving the top 6 teams. If a tie-breaker is needed, the team with the most bench points would advance. The top 2 ranked teams will receive a bye during week 15. The #1 seed will play the lowest remaining seed during week 16.</p>

  <h2>Free Agent Acquisition Budgets (FAAB):</h2>
  <p>To begin the season, each owner will receive $100 to place blind bids on waived players. The owner with the highest bid at the end of the waiver period claims that player and that bid amount is deducted from the team's acquisition budget. If multiple managers place an equal bid on a player, the owner with the most recent acquisition would lose out on the bid. Bids will be processed on Wednesdays.</p>
  <p>After the draft, all unowned players will follow waiver rules.</p>
  <p>Unclaimed players will become free agents until the start of their next game after the bids are processed.</p>
  <p>Dropped players will be placed on waivers for 2 days.</p>
  <h2>Trades:</h2>
  <p>All trades will be reviewed by the Executive Committee. All grievances should be discussed with a member of the Executive Committee.</p>
  <h2>Trophies:</h2>
  <p>Trophy recipients will be expected to maintain the safe keeping of their trophy during their reign as Champion. Transfer of the Ice from one Champion to the next will be done in a respectful manner.</p>
  <h2>Sacko:</h2>
  <p>The loser of the BBC Barf Bowl receives the last choice of draft pick the next year. They also receive the Sacko. Currently, the Sacko requires the owner to purchase the ACT test and take it, whereby if a score of 30 or more is achieved they reverse their fortunes and get first choice in the draft.</p>
